# React Native FlatList Blank Screen Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using FlatList in React Native: blank screen or inconsistent rendering when using dynamically calculated styles.  The problem is often caused by incorrect updating of styles based on state or props within the FlatList items.

## Bug Description
The bug manifests as a blank screen or inconsistent rendering of items in a FlatList. This occurs when the styles of the items rely on props or state changes, and the FlatList doesn't properly re-render the items with the updated styles.

## Solution
The solution involves using techniques such as `useMemo` or `React.memo` to optimize the rendering process and ensure that the FlatList correctly updates the styles when the related props or state values change.  Using `keyExtractor` correctly is also crucial for FlatList to effectively manage item re-rendering.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the blank screen or inconsistent rendering in the FlatList. The solution file demonstrates how to resolve this.
