This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and you attempt to render items that contain dynamic styles that depend on state or props.  If the styles are incorrectly calculated or updated, it may lead to inconsistent rendering or the blank screen issue. The problem often arises from the way FlatList manages and re-renders its items. If a style calculation depends on a component's props and those props change frequently, FlatList might not re-render the component with the updated styles correctly.
