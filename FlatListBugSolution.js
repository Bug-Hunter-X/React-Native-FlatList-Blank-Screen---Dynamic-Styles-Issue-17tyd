In the solution, we use `useMemo` to optimize the style calculation. This ensures that styles are only recalculated when necessary, improving performance and preventing rendering issues.  The `keyExtractor` is also correctly implemented to ensure that FlatList efficiently manages item updates. This combination effectively addresses the blank screen or inconsistent rendering problem.
